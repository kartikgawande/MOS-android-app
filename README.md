This is an android App I developed from scratch. I wanted a app where I can save my daily thoughts at and wanted it to periodically remind me those thoughts in notifications. We often get some really nice thoughts but then even if we note them down somewhere we forget to ever revise them and then that thought is basically usually forgotted. However I didnt find such an app on play store.
So I decided to make my own, that resulted in the creation of this app. You can input any text ( Your thought that u liked) tag it according to which area of life it belong to (ex. Physical, Social, Mental, Emotional and financial).
You can also classify the thought as 'Experimental' meaning that the thought is new and u havent yet tested it's correctness in real life, then u can classify it as "Tested' or 'Discarded' to note if the thought was found to be 
useful or not. This app has been a my companions since almost a year now at the time of this writing and it helps me revise my thoughts. 

# Thought Keeper

## Overview

Thought Keeper is an Android app designed for those who want to capture and periodically revisit their daily thoughts. Often, we come across profound thoughts that are easily forgotten even if noted down. This app aims to solve that issue by not only allowing users to save their thoughts but also reminding them to revisit these thoughts through periodic notifications.

## Features

- **Thought Input**: Users can input any text to capture thoughts they find significant.
- **Categorization**: Thoughts can be tagged according to the area of life they relate to, such as Physical, Social, Mental, Emotional, and Financial.
- **Status Classification**: Users can classify thoughts as:
  - `Experimental`: The thought is new and has not yet been tested in real life.
  - `Tested`: The thought has been applied and found useful.
  - `Discarded`: The thought was tested but found not to be useful.

## Motivation

Unable to find an existing app that met these needs, I created Thought Keeper to serve as a personal companion for capturing and managing thoughts. This app has been a vital part of my daily routine for almost a year, helping me consistently revisit and reflect on my thoughts.

## Getting Started

To get started with Thought Keeper, simply download the app from the Play Store, and begin logging your thoughts. Customize your experience by tagging and classifying your thoughts to make them easy to manage and revisit.
