# MOS App (A thought keeper app)

## Overview

MOS app is an Android app designed for those who want to capture and periodically revisit their daily thoughts. Often, we come across profound thoughts that are easily forgotten even if noted down. This app aims to solve that issue by not only allowing users to save their thoughts but also reminding them to revisit these thoughts through periodic notifications.

## Features

- **Thought Input**: Users can input any text to capture thoughts they find significant.
- **Categorization**: Thoughts can be tagged according to the area of life they relate to, such as Physical, Social, Mental, Emotional, and Financial.
- **Status Classification**: Users can classify thoughts as:
  - `Experimental`: The thought is new and has not yet been tested in real life.
  - `Tested`: The thought has been applied and found useful.
  - `Discarded`: The thought was tested but found not to be useful.
- **Automatic Cloud Backup**: All your thoughts are auto-backedup on your own google drive.
- **Synces between devices**: Your thoughts will be synced between all your android devices!

## Motivation

Unable to find an existing app that met these needs, I created MOS app to serve as a personal companion for capturing and managing thoughts. This app has been a vital part of my daily routine for almost a year, helping me consistently revisit and reflect on my thoughts.
